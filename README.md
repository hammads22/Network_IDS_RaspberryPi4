# Network_IDS_RaspberryPi4
Since covid many people have moved to the “Work from Home” lifestyle. Many companies have downgraded to only keeping the essential employees. So, what if a company or an individual does not want to spend money on cyber security teams or on hiring firms?  What if we could build a low cost, minimal and to some extent even portable security system that could be attached to their network?  Raspberry Pi is a versatile and widely used IoT/Smart Computing device that can run many Linux distributions with its ARM-based efficient cortex. Apart from that it also supports ether and GPIO ports which can be used to connect to many appliances.   Since raspberry pi supports many Linux distributions, we can install a lightweight distribution and build up upon it.  Since the Pi also has a built-in Wi-Fi card and supports many Wi-Fi adapters with monitor mode, we can combine these to make it work like a Firewall, have DNS/DHCP capabilities and set up monitoring for intrusion detection.
